**Note: While the example below works great, I (jsoma) would recommend using the code above or looking at the most recently updated on under /examples in this project**

Seeing example is always the best way to understand how it works. Here is an
[example](http://o1123.com/raphael-radar/example/index.html). 

I am thinking of making the page nicer and adding an example to handling events
on the chart near future.


TODO
----

* Better example page with code view.
* License information.


Special Thanks to

* [Jonathan Soma](https://github.com/jsoma)
* KURAZEKO Kyohe for original version.
* Yoshihide Tsuda for designing a rich version of sample chart.
